You are a senior full-stack software architect and developer.

Build a complete SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM with the following strict requirements and architecture.

========================
PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
========================
- Use a MONOREPO structure
- Create TWO SEPARATE folders:
  1) frontend/  → Admin Panel (Web)
  2) backend/   → API Server

========================
TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
========================
Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern UI (Glassmorphism / Soft gradients / Clean cards)
- Responsive dashboard layout
- Ready for deployment on VERCEL
- Use environment variables properly

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Ready for deployment on RENDER
- Use dotenv
- Clean MVC structure

Database:
- MongoDB (Local + Atlas compatible)
- Admin will use MongoDB Compass locally

========================
AUTHENTICATION LOGIC
========================
- ONLY ONE ADMIN (hard rule)
- Admin login via email + password
- Admin credentials stored securely (hashed password)
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (admin, teacher, student)
- Teachers & Students login ONLY from the APP later (but backend must support it)

========================

Student Performance:
- Class-wise performance
- Individual student performance

8️⃣ NOTICE MANAGEMENT
Admin & Teachers can create notices
Admin has FULL CONTROL:

  - Medium
  - High
- Attach files (PDF, image)
- Timestamped notices

Teachers:

│   ├── routes/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── server.js
│
│── .env
│── package.json

Models required:
- Admin
- Student
- Teacher
- Class
- Subject
- Timetable
- Notice
- Attendance
- Quiz (future-ready)

========================
FRONTEND STRUCTURE
========================
frontend/
│── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── utils/
